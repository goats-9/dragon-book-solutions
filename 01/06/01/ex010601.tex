    For the block-structured C code of \cref{code:010601}, indicate the values assigned to 
    \textit{w}, \textit{x}, \textit{y}, and \textit{z}.

\begin{solution}\label{sol:010601}
    Inside block 1, a new local variable \texttt{j} is initialized 
    with the value 7, and the value of \texttt{i} in the global scope is changed 
    to 6. Thus, the value of \texttt{w} is 13.

    \noindent In block 2, \texttt{j} has the value 5 from its global definition,
    and the value of \texttt{i} was changed to 6 in block 1. Therefore, the 
    value of \texttt{x} is 11.

    \noindent In block 3, a new local variable \texttt{i} is initialized
    with the value 8, and the value of \texttt{j} is 5 from its global scope.
    Thus, the value of \texttt{y} is 13.

    \noindent In block 4, the value of \texttt{z} is the same as \texttt{x},
    since no further changes are made to the values of \texttt{i} or \texttt{j}.
    Thus, the value of \texttt{z} is 11.
