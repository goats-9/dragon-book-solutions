\begin{solution}\label{sol:010602}
    Inside block 1, a new local variable \texttt{i} is initialized 
    with the value 5, and the value of \texttt{j} in the global scope is changed 
    to 4. Thus, the value of \texttt{w} is 9.

    \noindent In block 2, there are no changes to the values of the global 
    variables \texttt{i} and \texttt{j}. Therefore, the value of \texttt{x} is 7.

    \noindent In block 3, a new local variable \texttt{j} is initialized
    with the value 6, and the value of \texttt{i} is changed to 7 in its global 
    scope. Thus, the value of \texttt{y} is 13.

    \noindent In block 4, the value of \texttt{i} is now 7 from block 3, and the 
    value of \texttt{j} is unchanged in its global scope. Thus, the value of 
    \texttt{z} is 11.
