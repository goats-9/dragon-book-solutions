\begin{exercise}\label{ex:010104}
    A compiler that translates a high-level language into another high-level 
    language is called a \textit{source-to-source} translator. What advantages 
    are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:010104}
    The advantages of using C as a target language for a compiler are as follows.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It may be less cumbersome to code in another language than in C.
        \item The C language already has a compiler that can be readily used, 
        and there is no need to create a new compiler for another language from 
        scratch.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
