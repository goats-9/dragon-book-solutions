\begin{exercise}\label{ex:020802}
    The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C 
    compiler might translate an if-statement into three-address code.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:020802}
    Suppose that the if-statment is of the form $\texttt{if ( } expr 
    \texttt{ ) } stmt;$. The equivalent three-address code would be as follows.
