\begin{exercise}\label{ex:020205}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item Show that all binary strings generated by the following grammar 
        have values divisible by 3. \textit{Hint.} Use induction on the number 
        of nodes in a parse tree.
        \begin{align*}
            num \yld 11\ |\ 1001\ |\ num\ 0\ |\ num\ num
        \end{align*}
        \item Does the grammar generate all binary strings with values divisible 
        by 3?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:ex020205}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item We prove the claim by induction on the number of nodes in a parse
        tree. For two nodes (including the root), we have two possibilities: 
        $S \yld \brak{11|1001}$ and both numbers are divisible by 3. This is 
        the base case. Suppose that the claim holds for all parse trees with upto
        $k$ nodes. Any parse tree with $k + 1$ nodes is of one of the two following
        forms.
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
            \item $num \yld num'\ 0$, where $num'$ has $k - 1$ nodes in its parse 
            tree.
            \item $num \yld num'\ num''$, where $num'$ and $num''$ have upto $k$ 
            nodes each in their parse trees, since the total number of nodes in 
            both parse trees sums up to $k$.
        \end{enumerate} 
        Clearly, in both cases, $num$ will be divisible by 3 by using the 
        inductive hypothesis, which proves our claim.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
