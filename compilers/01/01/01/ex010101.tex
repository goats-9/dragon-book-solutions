\begin{exercise}\label{ex:010101}
    What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:010101}
    The differences are illustrated in \autoref{tab:010101}.

            \hline

            It translates a program from source language to an equivalent program 
            in the target language.
            &
            It executes the instructions in the source program directly without 
            translation. \\
            \hline
            Inputs are provided to the target program. 
            & 
            Inputs are provided directly to the source program. \\
            \hline
            Produces worse error diagnostics since it translates the entire source 
            program in one step without executing it.
            &
            Produces better error diagnostics since it executes the source program
            line by line. \\
            \hline
            Faster in mapping inputs to outputs.
            &
            Slower in mapping inputs to outputs. \\
