\begin{exercise}\label{ex:010103}
    What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which the 
    compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:010103}
    The advantages of a compiler producing assembly language instead of machine
    language are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assembly language is easier to produce as output.
        \item Assembly language is easier to debug.
        \item One can use available assemblers for the hardware to convert the
        assembly language into machine code.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
