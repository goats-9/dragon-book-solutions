\begin{exercise}\label{ex:020202}
    What language is generated by the following grammars? In each case justify 
    your answer.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item $S \yld 0\ S\ 1\ |\ 0\ 1$
        \item $S \yld \texttt{+}\ S\ S\ |\ \texttt{-}\ S\ S\ |\ \texttt{a}$
        \item $S \yld S\ \texttt{(}\ S\ \texttt{)}\ S\ |\ \epsilon.$
        \item $S \yld \texttt{a}\ S\ \texttt{b}\ S\ |\ \texttt{b}\ S\ \texttt{a}\ S |\ \epsilon$
        \item $S \yld \texttt{a}\ |\ S\ \texttt{+}\ S\ |\ S\ S\ |\ S^{\ *}\ |\ (\ S\ )$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:020202}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item We prove that the language generated is $\cbrak{0^n1^n\ |\ n > 0}$ 
        by induction on $n$. For $n = 1$, we see that $S \yld 01$. Suppose 
        $S \drv 0^k1^k$ for some $k > 0$. Then, we have
        \begin{align*}
            S \yld 0S1 \drv 00^k1^k1 = 0^{k+1}1^{k+1}
        \end{align*}
        which proves the claim.

        \item Similar to \cref{ex:020201}, the given grammar generates all prefix 
        expressions containing only the \texttt{+} and \texttt{-} operands.

        \item This grammar generates all balanced bracketing sequences containing only
        parentheses. We show this by using the definition.

        \noindent Clearly, we see that $S \yld \epsilon$, so the base 
        case holds. Now, suppose that $x$ is a balanced bracketing sequence 
        in this language. Then, we also see that
        \begin{align*}
            S \yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S 
            \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)} \drv \texttt{(}x\texttt{)}
        \end{align*}
        or $\texttt{(}x\texttt{)}$ is also in this language. Suppose also 
        that $x = \texttt{(}x'\texttt{)}$ and $y = \texttt{(}y'\texttt{)}$ are 
        balanced bracketing sequences in this language without loss of 
        generality. Then,
        \begin{align*}
            S \yld S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S
            \yld \texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S\texttt{(}S\texttt{)}S
            \drv \texttt{(}x'\texttt{)(}y'\texttt{)} = \textit{xy}. 
        \end{align*}
        which proves the claim. Note that if $x$ and $y$ are not in the required 
        form, then we can apply the above derivation multiple times as needed to 
        get the required form.

        \item This grammar generates all strings with equal occurrences of 
        \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} (including the empty string). This is 
        because, in any rule, whenever an \texttt{a} is added, a \texttt{b} 
        is also added.

        \item This grammar generates regular expressions containing \texttt{a}
        and the union and star operations along with parentheses. We prove this 
        claim by definition. Clearly, $S \yld \texttt{a}$ is in this language. 
        If any regular expressions $R$ and $T$ are in this language, then
        \begin{align*}
            S &\yld \brak{S} \drv \brak{R} \\
            S &\yld S^{\ *} \drv R^{\ *} \\
            S &\yld S\ \texttt{+}\ S \drv R\ \texttt{+}\ T \\
            S &\yld SS \drv RT
        \end{align*}
        and this proves the claim.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
