\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030312}
    SQL allows a rudimentary form of patterns in which two characters have 
    special meaning: underscore (\texttt{\textunderscore}) stands for any one 
    character and percent-sign (\texttt{\%}) stands for any string of 0 or more 
    characters. In addition, the programmer may define any character, say $e$, 
    to be the escape character, so an $e$ preceding , \texttt{\textunderscore}, 
    \texttt{\%}, or another $e$ gives the character that follows its literal 
    meaning. Show how to express any SQL pattern as a regular expression, given 
    that we know which character is the escape character.

\begin{solution}\label{sol:030312}
    Using \texttt{Lex} regular expression, we have the following equivalent 
    regular expressions in \autoref{tab:030312}.
