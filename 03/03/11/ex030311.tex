\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030311}
    The UNIX shell command \texttt{sh} uses the operators in \autoref{tab:030311}
    in filename expressions to describe sets of file names. For example, the 
    filename expression \texttt{*.o} matches all file names ending in \texttt{.o}; 
    \texttt{sort1.?} matches all filenames of the form \texttt{sort1.}$c$, where 
    $c$ is any character. Show how \texttt{sh} filename expressions can be 
    replaced by equivalent regular expressions using only the basic union, 
    concatenation, and closure operators.
