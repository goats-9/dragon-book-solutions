\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030307}
    Note that these regular expressions give all of the following symbols 
    (\emph{operator characters}) a special meaning:
    
    \texttt{\textbackslash\ " . \^{} \$ [ ] * + ? \{ \} | /}
    
    \noindent Their special meaning must be turned off if they are needed to represent 
    themselves in a character string. We can do so by quoting the character 
    within a string of length one or more; e.g., the regular expression 
    \texttt{"**"} matches the string \texttt{**}. We can also get the literal 
    meaning of an operator character by preceding it by a backslash. Thus, the 
    regular expression \texttt{\textbackslash*\textbackslash*} also matches the 
    string \texttt{**}. Write a regular expression that matches the string 
    \texttt{"\textbackslash}.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:030307}
    The required regular expression is \texttt{\textbackslash"\textbackslash\textbackslash}.
