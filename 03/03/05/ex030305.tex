\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030305}
    Write regular definitions for the following languages:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item All strings of lowercase letters that contain the ve vowels in 
        order.
        \item All strings of lowercase letters in which the letters are in 
        ascending lexicographic order.
        \item Comments, consisting of a string surrounded by \texttt{/*} and 
        \texttt{*/}, without an intervening \texttt{*/}, unless it is inside 
        double-quotes (\texttt{"}).
        \item All strings of digits with no repeated digits. \emph{Hint}: Try 
        this problem first with a few digits, such as $\cbrak{0,1,2}$.
        \item All strings of digits with at most one repeated digit.
        \item All strings of \texttt{a}'s and \texttt{b}'s with an even number 
        of \texttt{a}'s and an odd number of \texttt{b}'s. 
        \item The set of Chess moves, in the informal notation, such as
        \texttt{{p-k4}} or \texttt{kbp}$\times$\texttt{qn}.
        \item All strings of \texttt{a}'s and \texttt{b}'s that do not contain
        the substring \texttt{abb}.
        \item All strings of \texttt{a}'s and \texttt{b}'s that do not contain
        the subsequence \texttt{abb}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:030305}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item Letting \texttt{C} denote the set of lowercase consonants, the 
        required regular expression is \texttt{C*a\texttt[Ca]*e[Ce]*i[Ci]*o[Co]*u[Cu]*}.
    \end{enumerate}
