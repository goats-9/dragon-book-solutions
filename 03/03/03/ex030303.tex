\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030303}
    In a string of length $n$, how many of the following are there?
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item Prefixes.
        \item Suffixes.
        \item Proper prefixes.
        \item Substrings.
        \item Subsequences.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:030303}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item There are $n$ prefixes, determined by the ending index.
        \item There are $n$ suffixes, determined by the starting index.
        \item Since the string itsef is a prefox but not a proper prefix of 
        itself, we have $n-1$ proper prefixes.
        \item Any two indices determine the start and end of a substring. 
        Thus, we have $\binom{n+1}{2}$ substrings.
        \item For each character of the string, we can choose to either include
        or exclude it, for a total of $2^n$ subsequences.
    \end{enumerate}
