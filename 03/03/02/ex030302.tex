\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030302}
    Describe the languages denoted by the following regular expressions.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item \texttt{a(a|b)*a}.
        \item \texttt{(($\epsilon$|a)b*)*}.
        \item \texttt{(a|b)*a(a|b)(a|b)}.
        \item \texttt{a*ba*ba*ba*}.
        \item \texttt{(aa|bb)*((ab|ba)(aa|bb)*(ab|ba)(aa|bb)*)*}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:030302}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item Strings that begin and end with \texttt{a}.
        \item \texttt{(a|b)*}.
        \item Strings whose third to last character is \texttt{a}.
        \item Strings that contain exactly three occurrences of 
        \texttt{b}.
        \item Strings that have an even difference in the occurrences of 
        \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}.
    \end{enumerate}
