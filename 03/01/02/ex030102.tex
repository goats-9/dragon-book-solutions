\begin{exercise}\label{ex:030102}
    Tagged languages like HTML or XML are di erent from conventional programming 
    languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very numerous (as in HTML) 
    or a user-de nable set (as in XML). Further, tags can often have parameters. 
    Suggest how to divide the following HTML document:
    \begin{listing}[!ht]
        \inputminted[]{html}{03/01/02/ex030102.html}
        \caption{Source code for \cref{ex:030102}.}
        \label{code:030102}
    \end{listing}

    \noindent into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values,
    and what should those values be?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}\label{sol:030102}
    The lexemes are divided as in \autoref{tab:030102}.
    \input{03/01/02/tab030102.tex}
\end{solution}
